Part 1: Sales Training Document & Cheat Sheet




About Our Company: 24-7 Restoration & Roofing


We are not just a roofing company; we are your expert partner in navigating the insurance and restoration process.
* Established and Trustworthy: We are a family-owned business, established in 2010. We're highly rated, focused on transparency, and our core values are putting people first, integrity, and transparency.
* Expertise in Insurance Claims: With 15 years of restoration experience, with 10 as an insurance-preferred vendor, we have a specialized supplement team that handles all the paperwork and coordination to maximize the value of a claim for the customer.
* Quality Workmanship: We build extremely high-quality roofs with our standard being a 10-year labor warranty (with options for up to 20 years). We get most jobs done in one day, and we go the extra mile by overusing underlayment, ice and water barriers, and flashings to create the most waterproofed, under-roof system possible.
* Comprehensive Support: We are a responsive, local team. Customers can hold the last check until they are fully satisfied. We are always available to answer calls and texts promptly.


Buyer's Psychology & The Sales Funnel


* Low-Risk Entry: The drone inspection is our low-risk entry point. Customers agree to it because it's not invasive and doesn't require a high commitment. Your goal is to get a "yes" to the drone, not to sell anything yet.
* Creating the Need: A customer may not believe the drone's accuracy once they're looking for a reason to say "no." The physical inspection is the next step to confirm the damage and create a need. This checks a box in their mind.
* Cost vs. Need: Once a homeowner has a confirmed need (holes in the roof), they shift to a "cost vs. need" mindset. Your job is to show them how our process meets their need with the lowest possible cost, leveraging their insurance.
* Financial Risk Reduction: To earn trust, you'll offer to create a best-case and worst-case scenario estimate before they file a claim. This shows we are working for them and want to limit their financial risk.


The Cost of Inaction: Why It's Urgent


This is the core of your sales pitch. Every customer needs to understand the risk of waiting.
* Insurance Risks: Insurance companies are businesses, not charities. Their primary concern is to lower payouts. They deny a lot of claims and underpay them in an effort to keep their budget low.
* Financial Risks: Waiting makes a full roof replacement much more expensive due to rising costs. Their deductible can increase with inflation or a policy change to a 2% deductible. Their policy could also turn into an Actual Cash Value (ACV) policy, which pays significantly less. Additionally, the average cost of a leak starts at $300, so waiting until a leak starts adds at least $300 to their out-of-pocket costs.
* Property Damage Risks: Unaddressed damage, like fractured matting, can lead to leaks, mold, and further deterioration of the home. A damaged roof can also lead to increased insurance premiums for the entire zip code, whether they file a claim or not. A new roof can even get them a discount.
________________


Stage 1: The Initial Contact & Drone Inspection


* Your #1 Goal: Confirm if the home fits into the parameters of having storm damage or not. If it does, set up a consultation to "(hopefully clear them of having damage)."
* The Pitch:
   * Context: Casually let the homeowner know that you were already in the air for a neighbor. This provides context and makes your presence feel less random.
   * Specificity: Talk about the specific types of homes in the neighborhood where you're seeing damage (e.g., "We've noticed a lot of homes in this area with three-tab shingles are getting hit particularly hard."). This adds credibility and makes the homeowner feel like they're being spoken to directly.
* Pre-framing the Drone Inspection: Casually but helpfully let them know that "we're hoping that they don't have much damage," in which case you would email a report. But if you do see any serious signs of leaking, deterioration, or anything that could lead to a problem down the road, you'll go ahead and get up there and inspect it. You can even tell them that we don't recommend people replace the roof unless they have fractured matting. Fractured matting is what happens when hail hits a shingle so hard that it cracks the felt underneath the shingle, creating an immediate vulnerability and potential leak.
* Handling Objections:
   * "They're being rude": Stay friendly, polite, and professional. Reply with a kind comment. If they continue to be rude, tell them to have a nice day and walk away. Don't engage.
   * "We already have a roofer": "That's great, I hope you're being taken care of. By the way, are they a family member or a friend?" This opens the door to more probing questions.
      * If they say "no," ask: "Did they happen to provide you photos so you could see all the damage?"
         * If they say "yes," respond: "Perfect."
         * If they say "no," respond: "Oh well. Did they at least get you an estimate?"
      * From there, you can start leading them down a path of questioning the other company's thoroughness.
   * "They're being avoidant": Treat this with higher urgency. Come back faster to catch them, especially since you know they are home. Low urgency means come back sooner.
* Key Point: The drone inspection is all about confirming the status of their roof. Nothing else happens at this stage.


Stage 2: Drone Review to Physical Inspection


* Your #1 Goal: Explain the need for a physical inspection and transition the customer from "low-risk" to "committed."
* Key Message: Your sense of urgency must match your message. If you say it's urgent, you need to act urgently.
* Handling Objections:
   * "I don't think I have damage": Explain that there are two types of damage: the kind that cracks a shingle and the kind that doesn't. Tell them, "I definitely see some bruises on the shingles. I'll get up there and look at them in person to see if any of them are cracked, which would indicate a hole and an immediate need. Even if it's not leaking yet, cracks will eventually leak, and after a certain point, insurance won't cover them. If the bruises on the shingles don't have cracks, you can go a little bit longer." This builds trust by giving them a low-pressure way out.
   * Hesitation: If you're struggling to get a "yes," it means you haven't done a good enough job explaining fractured matting, or the benefits and costs of inaction.
* Combining Inspections: If you're the person who can do both the drone and the physical inspection, it's best to knock both out during the same visit to avoid having to come back twice. If not, it's totally okay to tell the homeowner you'll have "your guy" come out and then explain what you found.
* Pre-Framing: If you find damage with the drone, you'll need to pre-frame the physical inspection. The reason is simple: if you see anything that looks like hail, you need to get up there to check for fractures or cracks. Everybody replaces a roof with holes in it, so the physical inspection is our way of creating a need by confirming those holes.


Stage 3: On-Roof Inspection & Sit-Down Presentation


* Your #1 Goal: Justify your value, build a cooperative mentality, and get agreement on all out-of-pocket costs and terms.
* The Detailed Physical Inspection: Take pictures of everything you find. A highly detailed inspection will allow you to more accurately convey our benefits and the full scope of the work to the customer.
* Key Differentiators:
   * Mention our 15 years of restoration experience, with 10 as an insurance-preferred vendor.
   * Use the "you and the customer versus their insurance" mindset after the physical inspection.
   * Explain that we will give them a best-case and worst-case scenario on what they might have to spend before they file a claim, limiting their financial risk.
* Advanced Negotiation: When you're in a tense negotiation or dealing with a low deductible, you can talk about our ability to fight for supplements that aren't yet approved. This builds immense gratitude and trust, as they see you fighting for them to get more money and cover their deductible.
* Key Point: This is where you have the most leverage. Get the customer's agreement on all out-of-pocket costs and terms before the claim is filed. You will never get this kind of leverage again.


Stage 4: Post-Claim Filing


* Your #1 Goal: Follow up and be the expert partner.
* The Adjuster's Inspection: You must be present for the adjuster's inspection. The homeowner needs to know that your presence is crucial for getting things approved. Before the adjuster arrives, give the homeowner clear instructions via text message. During the inspection, make sure to stay after to confirm all the details with the homeowner.
* Handling Objections:
   * "An unforeseen insurance obstacle popped up": The homeowner may bring up a new, unexpected issue with their policy or the claim process. This is the only type of objection you should see at this stage.
* Key Point: All deductible and out-of-pocket conversations should have already happened in Stage 3. You should never be going through the deductible at this point; that's how you lose deals.


Stage 5: Final Sit-Down & Contract


* Your #1 Goal: Close the deal by presenting the approved claim as the final budget and reinforcing your commitment.
* Prepare for the Meeting: Bring a contract, a computer, a pen, and samples.
* Negotiation Strategy: Start by grabbing their new scope of work. Use this as your starting point. You can use the old scope for certain credits if needed. If you are still short on the deductible, you can reference the old scope and make a reasonable promise on what you feel you can still get approved from the insurance company. This negotiation builds trust and shows you are still fighting for them.
* Closing Without Asking: After you have negotiated and figured out what makes the homeowner happy, start using the back of the contract, which has a tally for credits, to get to the deductible. Once you meet the deductible, tell them it's all good. Then, without asking them if they want to sign, start asking about the next steps. For example, "What colors are you thinking about?" or "What day would be good to install?"
* The Contract Process:
   * Start by asking them to fill out the top section (name, address, email, phone number).
   * Once they slide it back to you, start explaining how we will build each line item.
   * If they interrupt you with questions, stop and answer them.
   * When you get to the bottom of the contract, ask them if they have any questions. They should be feeling pretty good about the process by now.
   * Once they are ready, you will sign the bottom and ask them for a date. Fill out the date, slide it over to them, and say, "I just need your autograph."
   * Try to get the contract signed before you finalize the colors. If they don't pick a date today, that's fine. Tell them you will check the schedule and get back to them tomorrow.

Part 2: Video Script


(Video opens with a shot of a sleek, modern office. The tone is professional but friendly. The narrator, a friendly, professional-looking person, is sitting at a desk with a computer and a pen. They have a tablet in front of them with the cheat sheet on it.)
NARRATOR: Hey everyone, and welcome to the team! Our goal here is simple: to give you the tools you need to succeed. Our customers aren't just getting a new roof; they're getting a partner to guide them through a complex process. This video is going to be your cheat sheet—a quick guide to our sales process, from the first hello to the final signature.
(On-screen graphic: "24-7 Restoration & Roofing" logo appears with key company benefits.)
NARRATOR: First, let's talk about who we are. We're a family-owned business, established in 2010. Our core values are putting people first, integrity, and transparency. But what really sets us apart is our expertise. We have 15 years of restoration experience, with 10 as an insurance-preferred vendor. We even have a specialized supplement team that fights for our customers. We also build our roofs to be the most waterproofed in the industry, using a strategic combination of underlayment, ice and water barriers, and flashings. And we stand behind our work with up to a 20-year labor warranty.
(On-screen graphic: "The Cost of Inaction" with bullet points.)
NARRATOR: Now, let's get to the most critical part of our message: the Cost of Inaction. Insurance companies are businesses, not charities. Their goal is to lower payouts. If a homeowner waits, their deductible can increase due to inflation or a policy change to a 2% deductible. They could even lose coverage with an ACV policy. And the damage will get worse. The average cost of a leak starts at $300, and that's just the beginning.
(On-screen graphic: "The 5 Stages of the Sale")
NARRATOR: Our sales process has five stages. Let's walk through each one.
(On-screen graphic: "Stage 1: Initial Contact & Drone Inspection" with an animated drone.)
NARRATOR: Stage 1: Initial Contact and the Drone Inspection. Our goal here is to see if the home fits into the parameters of having storm damage. We start by giving a friendly, casual pitch. We might mention we were already in the air for a neighbor and that we've noticed damage on similar homes in the area. We then pre-frame the drone inspection. We tell them, "We're hoping that you don't have much damage," and that if we don't see any issues, we'll just email them a report. But if we do see signs of leaking, deterioration, or fractured matting, we’ll get up on the roof for a physical inspection. Fractured matting is when hail cracks the felt under the shingle, creating a vulnerability.
(On-screen graphic: "Handling Objections" with a question mark and a list of common objections.)
NARRATOR: You’ll face objections. If they're rude, be professional, stay friendly, and walk away if they continue. If they say they have another roofer, ask if they're a family member or a friend. This helps you figure out how to counter with questions about whether that roofer provided photos or a detailed estimate. If they're being avoidant, come back faster—low urgency means a faster follow-up.
(On-screen graphic: "Stage 2: Drone Review to Physical Inspection" with a magnifying glass icon.)
NARRATOR: Stage 2: The Review and Physical Inspection. The moment your drone shows possible damage, your sense of urgency must match your message. If they're hesitant, you can explain that there are two types of damage: a shingle bruise and a shingle crack. You'll tell them you see bruises and need to check for cracks, which are the real problem. You can then add, "If the bruises on the shingles don't have cracks, you can go a little bit longer," which gives them a low-pressure way out while building trust. Remember, if you can do the physical inspection yourself, do it now to avoid a second trip.
(On-screen graphic: "Stage 3: On-Roof Inspection & Sit-Down Presentation" with a clipboard.)
NARRATOR: Stage 3: The Sit-Down Presentation. This is where you justify our value. You'll perform a detailed physical inspection, taking pictures of everything. You'll explain that we're their expert partner against the insurance company. We will give them a best-case and worst-case financial scenario before they even file a claim to reduce their risk. This is also where you set the terms and get agreement on all out-of-pocket costs—you won't get this leverage again. We even have a proprietary process where we fight for supplements not yet approved, which builds immense gratitude.
(On-screen graphic: "Stage 4: Post-Claim Filing" with a phone icon and a calendar.)
NARRATOR: Stage 4: Post-Claim Filing. This is where you are the expert partner and project manager. You must be present for the adjuster's inspection, and the homeowner must know your presence is crucial. Keep them in the loop with clear instructions via text message before, during, and after the adjuster leaves. This is also where we should not be discussing the deductible. That conversation should be settled in Stage 3.
(On-screen graphic: "Stage 5: Final Sit-Down & Contract" with a pen signing a document.)
NARRATOR: Stage 5: The Final Sit-Down and Contract. Be ready to close. Bring a contract, computer, pen, and samples. Use the new scope of work as your guide. If you need to negotiate a bit to meet the deductible, you can use the credits from the old scope or make a reasonable promise about getting a new supplement approved. Use the back of the contract for a credit tally to get to the deductible. Once you've met their expectations, don't ask if they want to sign. Instead, fill out the top part of the contract, then fill in the price. Explain how we’ll build each line item. At the bottom, ask, "Do you have any questions?" When you're ready to close, simply ask, "What day would you like to install?" or "What color are we going with?" This makes signing feel like the next natural step in the process.
(Video fades out on the narrator smiling, with the logo and a contact number on screen.)

Scenario-Based Questions (5 points)


   1. Scenario: You have just finished your pitch and drone inspection. The homeowner is impressed with your professionalism but says, "Thank you so much, I'll think about it and give you a call." How do you respond to maintain control of the conversation and secure a follow-up appointment?
   2. Scenario: You're in Stage 2. Your drone has identified what you believe to be fractured matting, but the homeowner is skeptical and says, "That's just a drone picture. I don't see anything wrong, and I don't want anyone on my roof." How do you handle this objection and transition them to a physical inspection?
   3. Scenario: You're in Stage 5, the final sit-down. The customer has signed the top portion of the contract, and you are starting to fill out the price section. They ask, "Is there any way we can get some cash back from this claim to pay for a new fence?" How do you respond while maintaining the integrity of our process?
   4. Scenario: You're in Stage 3, and the customer is concerned about their high deductible. They say, "I'm not sure if I can afford the deductible, so I don't think I can move forward." How do you address their concern using the negotiation tactics from the training to build trust and show them we are working for them?
   5. Scenario: You have successfully finished the final sit-down and are closing the deal. You have addressed all their concerns and met their deductible with credits. What is the last thing you do to seal the deal without asking for the homeowner to sign?
